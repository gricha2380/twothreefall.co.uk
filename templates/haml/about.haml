        %p I'm Sam, I live and work in Edinburgh.  Slowly this website is coming together.
        %p The source for twothreefall.co.uk is available on <a href="https://github.com/aradnuk/twothreefall.co.uk">GitHub</a>

        %h2#lex Last.fm Explorer
        %p <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/aradnuk">I</a> love Last.fm to pieces.

        %h3 Changelog

                Use <a href="http://lxml.de/">lxml</a> to parse XML from Last.fm and avoid very occasional syntax errors caused by invalid control codes in some weekly charts.
                Way fewer updates will get stuck now.
            %li
                %strong 03-06-2012
                Remove all uses of MusicBrainz ids &mdash; Last.fm seem to change the ids attached to artists arbitrarily.

                Bit of a restyle.
            %li
                %strong 19-12-2011
                Fixed incorrect chart averages.  Thanks to <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/m2wester">m2wester</a> for spotting this.
            %li
                %strong 23-10-2011
                Introduced an index page for all weekly charts.

                Fixed it!

                There's a weird problem with saving new artists to the database.
                Sometimes it occurs, sometimes it doesn't.. I'm working on it.
